# Hi, I'm Nicolas 👋

## 🔍 About Me

I'm a Master's student in Anthropology exploring the intersection of social research and computational methods. My work focuses on developing innovative approaches to understand complex social systems through the integration of qualitative insights with quantitative analysis.

### 🌐 Current Focus

- **Digital Anthropology**: Researching systemic issues in urban contexts through computational approaches
- **Systems Thinking**: Applying Gregory Bateson's systems theory to both research and code architecture
- **Data Science for Social Good**: Building Python pipelines that bridge ethnographic methods with data analysis
- **AI & Society**: Working as a data annotator, contributing to ethical AI development while studying its societal impacts

## 💡 Interdisciplinary Approach

I believe in the power of combining traditional anthropological methods with modern computational tools. My approach is inspired by systems thinking - understanding not just individual components, but the patterns and relationships that connect them.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Languages**: Python (primary), with a focus on data analysis and automation
- **Data Science**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLP tools
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, network analysis
- **Research Tools**: Qualitative data analysis, mixed-methods approaches
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, data modeling for complex social phenomena

## 🎯 What I'm Working On

- Developing computational methods for analyzing qualitative research data
- Creating tools that make social research more accessible and reproducible
- Exploring how AI and machine learning can enhance (not replace) human understanding
- Building bridges between academic research and practical applications

## 🌱 Learning Journey

As someone still growing in the coding world, I'm passionate about:
- Writing clean, well-documented code that other researchers can understand
- Applying systematic thinking to both research design and software architecture
- Contributing to open-source projects that advance social research methods

## 🤝 Collaboration

I'm always interested in connecting with others working at the intersection of:
- Social sciences and technology
- Qualitative and quantitative methods
- Systems thinking and software design
- Ethical AI and social justice

## 📚 Background

- **Anthropology**: Ethnographic methods, cultural analysis, systems theory
- **Language Documentation**: Experience with endangered language preservation
- **Mixed Methods**: Combining computational approaches with traditional fieldwork
- **Tech for Social Impact**: Using data science to address real-world challenges
